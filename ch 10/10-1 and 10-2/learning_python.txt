in python you can manipulate lists, but lists doesnt work for all scenarios and can be too complicated for when to order items, so you can use dictonaries.
You can also loop through the list or dictonary to look for specific items and then print it out for the user, you can also use a combination of lists/dictonaries with loops
to analyse data and save time by not having to manually go through everything yourself.
